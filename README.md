# pylapse

Ruby script for driving timelapses using a raspi camera.

Intention of this was to automate progressive changes in the shutterspeed and iso settings based around sunset and sunrise times. The result had mixed levels of success. 
Clouds and stuff made it hard to workout light levels based on just those params. 

Although generally the timelapses made with this were better than standard camera timelapse rigs during time periods where light levels are changing drastically.

Requires looking up sunset and sunrise then configuring the sequence at the bottom of the tl.rb script to requirements.
